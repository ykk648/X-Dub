## 🔥 Updates
- **`2026/03/19`**: 🔥 We release the [inference code](#3--inference) and [pretrained weights](https://huggingface.co/KlingTeam/X-Dub) for the public Wan-based X-Dub release.
- **`2025/12/31`**: 🔥 We release the paper and project homepage: [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25066) | [homepage](https://hjrphoebus.github.io/X-Dub/).


## 📖 Introduction

This repository contains the official PyTorch implementation of **X-Dub**, introduced in [*From Inpainting to Editing: Unlocking Robust Mask-Free Visual Dubbing via Generative Bootstrapping*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.25066) (formerly *From Inpainting to Editing: A Self-Bootstrapping Framework for Context-Rich Visual Dubbing*).

Due to company policy, we cannot open-source the internal model used in the paper. This repository instead releases a public X-Dub (Wan-5B) version based on Wan2.2-TI2V-5B. Because of the different backbone, we do not use the LoRA tuning described in the paper; instead, we use multi-stage SFT in the public release to achieve a similar effect. In our experiments, X-Dub (Wan-5B) produces satisfying lip-synced results broadly aligned with the internal version X-Dub (internal-1B):

We still observe some differences in the current public release.
Compared with the internal version, X-Dub (Wan-5B) shows the following practical differences:

- Better generalization to non-human characters such as cartoons, animated roles, and animals.
- Slightly weaker temporal stability, with occasional flickering.
- Slightly weaker subject consistency, including possible identity drift or color drift.
- Occasional severe noisy frames in a small portion of cases (~2%).
- Roughly 2× slower inference without acceleration strategies.

🏃 We are still trying to find the best implementation strategy, and will actively improve this repository. Quantitative comparisons between the public release and the internal version will be reported in future updates. If you have suggestions, please open an issue for discussion.




## 🏁 Getting Started

⚠️ Inference typically requires ~21 GB VRAM.

### 1. 🛠️ Clone the code and prepare the environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/KlingAIResearch/X-Dub.git
cd X-Dub
```

This repository now ships a `uv` configuration for the main CUDA inference path. The default setup targets:

- Python `3.10.x`
- CUDA `12.8`
- PyTorch CUDA wheels from `https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128`

Sync the environment:

```bash
uv sync
```

If package downloads are slow, retry with a longer timeout and your shell proxy variables:

```bash
UV_HTTP_TIMEOUT=300 uv sync
```

`ffmpeg` is still required as a system executable because the preprocessing and muxing steps call the CLI directly.

Optional attention acceleration backends are intentionally not locked into the base environment because their version compatibility is more fragile than the main inference stack.

If you want to try FlashAttention after the base environment works, install it separately:

```bash
uv pip install flash-attn==2.8.3 --no-build-isolation
```

### 2. 📥 Download pretrained weights

Download the released bundle directly to `checkpoints/`:

```bash
uv run hf download KlingTeam/X-Dub --local-dir ./checkpoints --repo-type model
```

If the Hugging Face download path is slow in your environment, add proxy variables to this command only instead of using them for the whole `uv sync`.

Move the DWpose files into `dwpose_tools/models/`:

```bash
mkdir -p dwpose_tools/models
cp -r ./checkpoints/dwpose_tools/models/. ./dwpose_tools/models/
rm -rf ./checkpoints/dwpose_tools
```

After download, the expected layout is:

└── rtmw-x_simcc-cocktail14_pt-ucoco_270e-384x288-f840f204_20231122.pth
```


### 3. 🚀 Inference

```bash
python infer_lip_sync_pipeline.py \
  --video_path assets/examples/video.mp4 \
  --audio_path assets/examples/audio.wav \
  --ckpt_path checkpoints/X-Dub_model.safetensors \
  --ref_cfg_scale 2.5 \
  --audio_cfg_scale 10.0 \
  --num_inference_steps 30 \
  --output_dir ./results
```


## 📢 Input Video Auto-Cropping
The inference pipeline supports arbitrary-size input videos and performs online auto-cropping. The current version supports **single-person** videos only. The inference script will:

- crop the faicial region
- run lip-sync generation on the cropped and resized video (512x512)
- map the generated result back to the original complete video

<details>
  <summary>Current cropping limitations</summary>

  For ease of use, this repository uses DWPose to estimate facial ldmks for cropping. This differs from the more complex offline FLAME-mesh-based cropping pipeline used in the paper.

  The current online strategy may introduce visible jitter and may fail to follow the face reliably when the head moves rapidly. The current release also does not support target tracking in multi-person scenes.

</details>

🏃 We plan to improve the cropping strategy and add better multi-person support in future updates.


## 💡 Practical Hints
- `ref_cfg_scale` and `audio_cfg_scale` control the balance between reference appearance fidelity and audio-driven mouth motion. Different cases may prefer slightly different values.
- We recommend setting `num_inference_steps` in the range of `25-50`. Higher values increase runtime and may improve quality, but this has not been exhaustively evaluated yet.


## 📝 TODO
- [ ] Report quantitative comparisons between the public version and the paper version.
- [ ] Support multi-person video dubbing.
- [ ] Improve the cropping pipeline.
- [ ] Inference acceleration.


## ⚖️ Ethical Considerations
This work can be misused for identity impersonation or deceptive synthetic media. We support clear labeling of AI-generated content and encourage further work on reliable detection methods. All models and materials in this repository are intended for academic research and technical demonstration only.
